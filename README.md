Docstring for python file "is_list_permutation.py":

This python file contains a programme that implements a function that takes in two lists
and calculates whether they are permutations of each other. The lists can contain both 
integers and strings. A permutation is defined as follows:

  1. The lists have the same number of elements.
  2. List elements appear the same number of times in both lists.
  
If the lists are not permutations of each other, the function returns False. 
If they are permutations of each other, the function returns a tuple consisting of the 
following elements:

  1. The element occuring the most times
  2. How many times that element occurs
  3. The type of the element that occurs the most times
  
If both lists are empty return the tuple (None, None, None). If more than one element occurs
the most number of times, you can return any of them.



Docstring for python file "triangular.py":

This python file contains a programme that takes an integer as an input and returns True
or False based on whether the given number is triangular or not.
A triangular number is a number obtained by the continued summation of integers starting 
from 1. For example, 1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4, etc., corresponding to 1, 3, 6, 10, etc., 
are triangular numbers.
