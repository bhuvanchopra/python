'''
This python file is a programme based on the word guessing game called 'Hangman'.
It is a game of two or more players in which one player thinks of a word, phrase 
or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, 
within a certain number of guesses.

In this programme and as well as in the stadard format of the game, 8 guesses are
given to the player to correctl guess the word. The programme is writtten in 
such a way that the computer tells the player the number of letters in the word
beforehand.

If the player guesses correctly,he/she wins. If not, then at the end of the programme,
when no more guesses are available with the player, the computer reveals the word.
